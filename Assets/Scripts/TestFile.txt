Hello? <i>(hello) (hello</i>
Is there <b>anybody</b> in there?
Just <color="red">nod</color> if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on (come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (relax) (relax)
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb
